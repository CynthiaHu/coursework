### Docker 101
This lab is a primer on docker, which in the past few years emerged as the dominant workload management and deployment tool.

Docker - https://www.docker.com/  - is a collection of tools around Linux Containers [which are a lightweight form of virtualization]. 
Linux Containers have been part of the Linux kernel for quite some time now, but the user space tooling has lagged, which provided 
an opportunity for Docker as a company.  Recently, Docker became available on MacOS X and even on Windows 10 Professional or later, in addition
to Linux. Note that while Docker on MacOS X is "native", it requires an underlying hypervisor on Windows. It is important to realize
that a linux container shares the kernel with the underlying VM or host; there is no need to copy the entire OS.  This is why the containers
are very small and light, they are easy to spin up and you can have many of them on devices as small as Raspberry Pi Zero..

#### Installing docker
If you already have docker running, you may skip this step.  However, you may wish to do it if you never installed docker on ubuntu.
This assumes that you have an slcli installed somewhere, e.g. on a VM in softlayer or in your local environment.

Let us spin up a clean VM:
```
apt-get install mosquitto
```

#### Running something in a docker container.
